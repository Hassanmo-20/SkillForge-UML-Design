This **Sequence Diagram** represents the process of a student enrolling in a course on the SkillForge platform. It shows how the UI, Service, and Database interact to check if the student is already enrolled, fetch course information, and respond accordingly. This diagram is important because it clarifies the system’s logic and communication flow, ensuring all components work together correctly during enrollment.
